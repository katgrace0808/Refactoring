# Refactoring
Defactoring of Horiseon website due to accessibility issues.

In the html file, replaced all div tags with semantic tags for easier narration.  
Added alt descriptions to all images and icons for narration visibility.
Moved background image to html file from css file.
Removed redundant and unused classes/ids.

In the css file, updated sort of selectors to coincide with the html file.
Combined redundant selectors that had the same property and values.
Removed unnecessary leading selectors within nested selectors for easier visual.

The result is the same website as before, but a compliant and accessible one.

I'm open to further suggestions for improvements or corrections.

Thanks to my UW Bootcamp Instructor and TAs for their guidance.  Couldn't have done this without them.
